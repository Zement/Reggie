fix(core): resolve multiple UI and data management issues

- Add native window controls to Patch Manager dialog
- Fix toolbar docking preferences not applying on startup
- Fix area creation crash in new unsaved levels
- Fix sprite editor tooltip AttributeErrors for missing notes
- Implement automatic cleanup of orphaned patch paths from settings
- Handle URL-encoded patch names in settings cleanup
- Remove @Invalid() entries from settings automatically
- Clean up orphaned LastLevel_ entries

The orphaned path cleanup runs at boot and when Patch Manager opens,
preventing errors from manually deleted patches. Supports URL-encoded
names like NSMBWer%2B and removes all related settings (PatchPath_,
StageGamePath_, TextureGamePath_, LastLevel_).

Note: NewerSMBW patch files removed from repository (patches folder now empty)
