feat(QPT): Phase 13-15 - Corner connections, fill tool, layer selection, UI polish

This commit covers Phases 13-15 of the Quick Paint Tool, plus several
bug fixes across the codebase.

## Phase 13: Terrain-Aware Corner Connections

- 90-degree corner connections: automatic inner/outer corners when
  painted terrain meets existing terrain (24 cases)
- 180-degree U-turn connections: opposite-type edges meeting cardinally
  produce paired corners (8 cases)
- 180-degree S-shape connections: same-type edges meeting diagonally
  produce complementary tight/open corners (8 cases)
- Collinear detection: same-type edges on same row/column are recognized
  as straight extensions, not corners (4 cases)
- Self-connection detection for closed shapes (loop closures)
- Endpoint connection detection for individual strokes meeting existing
  terrain
- All 92 terrain-aware corner test cases passing

## Phase 14: Fill Tool Enhancements

- Overpaint: 4 additional rows/cols outside zone edges where fill
  touches the boundary, plus 4x4 corner blocks at zone corners
- Shift+Fill: hold Shift to allow filling outside zone boundaries
  using a 200x200 tile bounding area
- Clear Area (F2): button and hotkey to delete all objects within the
  current fill preview area; respects slope empty tiles (-1)
- Auto-fill fix: closed polygons touching top/left zone edges now
  correctly trigger auto-fill (iterates all placement positions for
  zone detection)
- Overpaint gap fix: overpaint only applies adjacent to positions
  actually touching the zone edge

## Phase 15: Layer Selection, UI Polish & Bug Fixes

### Layer Selection (all QPT tools)
- Added "Paint on Layer: 0 1 2" radio buttons to QPT tab (below
  Painting Mode combobox) and Fill Paint tab (above tileset selector)
- Default layer is 1; resets to 1 on area/level change
- All layer radio buttons are synced: QPT tab, Fill Paint tab, and
  Objects palette tab stay in sync when any one changes
- SmartPaint, Single Tile, Eraser, Fill, Deco Fill, and Clear Area
  all respect the selected layer
- Fill area determination (flood fill) uses the selected layer for
  occupied-tile checks

### Hotkey Overlay
- F3 toggles the Quick Paint overlay menu visibility
- Main container label renamed from "Tools" to "Tools (F3)"
- Added F3 to qpt_keys forwarding in reggie.py

### Stroke Self-Crossing Prevention for Slopes
- Stroke path now blocked from crossing through committed slope objects
  (full canvas footprint, not just path positions)
- Preview slopes also block the path during slope mode
- Uses slope dimensions (width x height) to compute actual tile
  coverage

### QPT Bug Fixes
- Pa1 tileset slot no longer resets painting mode to SmartPaint when
  switching tilesets (preserve_mode parameter in load_preset_into_ui)
- Slope mode: immediate default slope suggestion on F1 enter and after
  committing a slope (_suggest_default_slope method)
- AssertionError on new area creation: skip load() if area is already
  loaded (_is_loaded check in level.py changeArea)
- Dampening factor default changed from 3 to 2; max increased to 10

## Non-QPT Changes

### GitHub Actions: Intel Mac Build
- Added build-macos-intel job (macos-13 runner) for legacy Intel Macs
- Renamed existing macOS job to build-macos-arm with -arm64 suffix
- Both ARM64 and Intel builds now produced on tag creation

### PyQt6 Compatibility Fixes
- Tile rendering artifacts at certain zoom levels: disabled
  SmoothPixmapTransform and Antialiasing in LevelScene.drawBackground()
- Sprite list images: render in temporary scene instead of main scene
  to avoid zoom artifacts on the main canvas
- ExternalSpriteOptionDialog: fixed exec_() -> exec() and
  QDialogButtonBox enum access for PyQt6
- Icon loading: removed .icns special case that crashes PyQt6 on
  macOS ARM64; always use PNG icons

### Other Fixes
- Mouse button scroll timer: reduced from 100ms to 30ms for smoother
  scrolling with forward/back mouse buttons
- raw_data.py: added get_block() helper method
